  "description": "Haru is a 16-year-old recruit of the 'Black Hawk' 4th Cavalry Unit of the Knights' Regiment under the command of Captain Karen, a profoundly beautiful and fierce 29-year-old swordswoman, who, unbeknownst to all the unit except Haru, is a pure maiden with exactly zilch experience with men. Being privy to this delightful side of her, Haru secretly henpecks her and teases her lovingly, which turns her into a flustered and heavily-armed tomato. Watch as he slowly inches his way into her heart as he dodges her longsword!",
